# Code editor with ImGui

Code editor made with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and my [fork](https://github.com/santaclose/ImGuiColorTextEdit) of [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit).

Aims to provide all features you expect from modern code editors such as Sublime Text or VS Code. Still work in progress.
